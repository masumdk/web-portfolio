      <p>I know this because when I came back from maternity leave, I was so surprised at all the new technologies and changes that happened while I was away. For example, every developer I knew was using Subversion before I stepped out of the loop. When I came back, Git had completely taken over.</p>

          <p>Because the corporate world changed drastically after that burst, I found myself more and more discontent working for companies that simply could not provide that same experience. I also found it harder and harder to find clients for my freelance web design gig.</p>

            <p>Bootstrap is an open-source CSS framework, which provides a base for creating mobile-first, responsive websites. Since its creation in 2011, its popularity has never stopped growing. Bootstrap now powers millions of websites. As the most popular CSS framework, it is mandatory that you learn to use it once comfortable enough with HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>HTML isn’t a programming language, neither CSS, but markup tools used to design web pages and user interfaces. HTML is a hypertext markup language that structures the content and layout of the web page, and CSS controls its display. It’s the very backbone of every website, therefore it is a must to learn for anyone aspiring to work in the front-end development field.</p>
